Users Searched For is a tool that records all searches made on your WordPress site. Detects if results were found.

== Description ==

Users Searched For (USF) is a lightweight plugin that hides under the **Admin backed -> Tools -> Users Searched For** menu. It records all the terms that your users have searched for on your WordPress site and displayes them in a dedicated section, where you can apply different filters.

This plugin is very useful if want to have a quick insight of what people are searching for on your site. 

Filters available (sorting options):

* pagination
* username or Visitor (detects if the user is logged in and displays its name)
* landing page (if the search returns results, these will be recorded by title and direct link)
* IP address - stores the user's IP address for later statistics (country, city, ISP)
* Time and date - eg 2015-08-29 17:31:09 - have a clear timestamp when a user made the search

TODO - no plugin is ever in a final form. However, the following will be implemented in the future versions:

* Display countries, cities and ISPs instead of IPs
* Make automatic suggestions based on search records for building new pages or posts
* Compatibility with top 20 search-enhancing plugins
* Daily/Weekly/Monthly reports, downloadable or sent by e-mail
* Export as CSV, XLS, PDF with customizable time segments
* Trends

Please feel free to send improvement requests.
