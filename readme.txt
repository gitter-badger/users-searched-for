Users Searched For is a lightweight tool that records all searches made on your WordPress site. Detects if results were found.

== Description ==

Users Searched For (USF) is a lightweight plugin that hides under the `Admin backend -> Tools -> Users Searched For` menu. It records all terms that your users have searched for on your WordPress site and displays them in a dedicated section, where you can apply different filters.

This plugin is very useful if want to have a quick insight of what people are searching for on your site. 

**Available Filters (sorting options):**

* pagination
* username or Visitor (detects if the user is logged in and displays the username)
* landing page (if the search returns results, these will be recorded by title and direct link)
* IP address - stores the user's IP address for later statistics (country, city, ISP)
* Time and date - e.g. 2015-08-29 17:31:09 - have a clear timestamp when the user made the search

**TODO** - no plugin is ever in a final form. However, the following will be implemented in a future version:

* Display countries, cities and ISPs instead of simple IPs
* Make automatic suggestions based on search records for building new pages or posts
* Compatibility with top 20 search-enhancing plugins
* Daily/Weekly/Monthly reports, downloadable or sent by e-mail
* Export as CSV, XLS, PDF with customisable time segments
* Trends

**Please feel free to send any improvement requests.**
